# Piano-Puzzle
This puzzle involves playing a specific set of notes on a piano to open a door. In this case, it's Brahm's Lullaby, but it could be anything really.
Initially, this puzzle involved all 5 keys and the code checked for all of them, but due to customer/hardware reliability, the amount of keys was worked down to 3, and only 3 in sequence.
The keys are wired to the arduino as if they were buttons, by attaching metallic tape to both contact ends of the hammers in an upright piano, so that a connection is made when they contact eachother.
Some workarounds and additional functionality needed to be added to avoid accidental double-strokes and the like, both due to human and mechanical error.
